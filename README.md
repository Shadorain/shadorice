# Shadorice

The rice fields for the shadows.

This repo has everything that my others explained below don't have.

## Window Manager

I use **Xmonad** as my window manager and it has never let me down.
Check out my repo here to see more about it: [shadoXmonad](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadoXmonad)

## Editor

Neovim is the editor I use and there is nothing better. An IDE is simply bloat and never has anything I
want, they're lethaly slow and simplty overkill. Neovim is lightning fast, highly extendible
can be made to look absolutely stunning, you literally can fly on your keyboard with the binds and modal
editing, and so much more.

Checkout my neovim setup and custom colorscheme here.

## Status bar

My bar is polybar but pretty decked out, I have an [older version](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadobar) of my bar
but the new and improved version 2 is so much better, here it is. [Shadobar 2.0](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadobar-2)

## Terminal / Shell

The terminal emulator I use is ST, suckless honestly is top of the top, really just
cant deny that simple fact. ST has been a blast to configure and patch and making my own
colorscheme for it has been wonderful as well. Here it is: [ShadoST](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadoST)

## Dunst, Zathura, Shell, and others

These are all in here and not in separate repos if you wanted to grab them from here.
